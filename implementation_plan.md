# Implementation Plan for ACM Optimizer Research

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the Adaptive Curvature Momentum (ACM) optimizer research project. The goal is to verify the superiority of the ACM optimizer across three experiments:

1. Real-World Convergence Experiment (using CIFAR-10 and ResNet-18)
2. Synthetic Loss Landscape Experiment (using quadratic and Rosenbrock functions)
3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity and Robustness Analysis (using a simple CNN)

## Directory Structure
Following the repository structure:
- `src/utils/optimizer.py`: Implementation of the ACM optimizer
- `src/preprocess.py`: Data preprocessing for experiments
- `src/train.py`: Model training functionality
- `src/evaluate.py`: Model evaluation functionality
- `src/main.py`: Main script to run all experiments
- `config/`: Configuration files for experiments
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages

## Implementation Steps

- Support training with different optimizers (ACM, Adam, SGD)
- Include functionality for all three experiments:
  - ResNet-18 training on CIFAR-10
  - Optimization on synthetic functions
  - Simple CNN training with hyperparameter grid search

### 4. Model Evaluation Implementation
- Implement evaluation functions in `src/evaluate.py`
- Include metrics calculation (loss, accuracy)
- Support visualization of results (learning curves, optimization trajectories)

### 5. Main Script Implementation
- Implement the main script in `src/main.py` to orchestrate all experiments
- Include command-line arguments for experiment selection and configuration
- Ensure detailed output for experiment results

### 6. Configuration Files
- Create configuration files in `config/` for each experiment
- Include hyperparameters and experiment settings

### 7. Requirements File
- Update `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages

### 8. Testing
- Implement a test mode for quick verification
- Ensure compatibility with NVIDIA Tesla T4 (16GB VRAM)
