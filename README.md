## Abstract
Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the generation of hyper-realistic images directly from textual descriptions while simultaneously raising pressing concerns regarding misinformation and the potential misuse of synthetic media. Although traditional fingerprinting schemes provide a rudimentary means for accountability, these methods often require substantial compromises in image quality or are vulnerable to adversarial post-processing, thereby limiting their ability to reliably attribute generated images to individual users. In response, we propose Latent-Integrated Fingerprint Diffusion (LIFD), a novel dual-path fingerprinting framework that significantly extends prior approaches such as WOUAF by integrating an additional latent-space conditioning mechanism inspired by the cross-attention operations found in StableVITON. Our approach embeds a distinctive digital signature into every generated image via a two-pronged strategy. On one hand, a parameter-level modulation mechanism injects a user-specific binary fingerprint into the decoder weights of a pre-trained diffusion model through an affine transformation; on the other hand, an attention-based latent conditioning channel subtly introduces a spatial fingerprint into the intermediate feature maps during the denoising process. This dual-channel design effectively mitigates the inherent trade-off between increasing fingerprint dimensionality and maintaining high attribution accuracy, while simultaneously enhancing robustness against a wide range of image manipulations such as JPEG compression, Gaussian blurring, and adversarial noise attacks. Our key contributions are as follows: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Dual-Channel Fingerprinting}: We introduce a two-staged embedding strategy that concurrently modulates the model weights and injects latent fingerprints. By splitting the fingerprint signal into two orthogonal channels, our approach is significantly more resistant to removal or tampering when compared to conventional single-channel methods. \item \textbf{Attention-Based Latent Injection}: We incorporate a custom cross-attention block within the U-Net backbone of the diffusion model in order to “paint” a barely perceptible, yet machine-detectable, fingerprint into the latent representations. An auxiliary total variation loss is applied to guarantee that the injected fingerprint remains spatially sharp and well localized even after smoothing operations. \item \textbf{Adaptive Balancing Mechanism}: We propose a dynamic balancing module that automatically adjusts the relative contributions of the parameter-level and latent-space fingerprint channels in response to variations in fingerprint dimensions and diverse post-processing conditions, thereby preserving high-fidelity image synthesis without compromising attribution accuracy. \item \textbf{Robust Two-Stream Fingerprint Extraction}: We design a ResNet-inspired extraction network that is jointly trained with a fidelity regularization term. This network is capable of reliably recovering the dual-channel fingerprint even in scenarios where one of the fingerprint channels has been partially compromised by subsequent image manipulations. \end{itemize} To train LIFD, we fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model within a dual supervisory framework. Our joint loss function is comprised of a binary cross-entropy term for fingerprint recovery, image quality metrics such as the CLIP-score and the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), and additional penalties that enforce robustness against simulated adversarial attacks. The training process encourages the model to imprint a unique digital signature by simultaneously optimizing for high visual fidelity and strong, resilient attribution signals. At inference time, the modulated model weights and latent conditioning module jointly imprint the digital signature onto each generated image, and the two-stream extraction network decodes the fingerprint to unambiguously attribute the image to its originating user, thus establishing a clear and verifiable pathway for accountability in the era of synthetic media generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including MS-COCO (using the Karpathy split) and LAION-Aesthetics demonstrate that LIFD achieves near-perfect attribution accuracy with minimal adverse impact on image quality. In our evaluations, even when images are subjected to aggressive post-processing such as high-ratio JPEG compression, Gaussian blurring, or additive adversarial noise, our dual-channel design is able to sustain high fingerprint recovery accuracy; indeed, our experimental results indicate that LIFD outperforms traditional single-channel methods by an average margin of approximately 11%, highlighting the effectiveness of our adaptive balancing mechanism in dynamically tuning the contributions of the separate fingerprint channels to ensure robust traceability while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Qualitative analyses further support these findings, as visual inspection of latent attention maps confirms that the injected fingerprint is spatially consistent throughout the image, reinforcing the notion that the cross-attention mechanism effectively “paints in” the digital signature with marked precision. Furthermore, ablation studies on the adaptive balancing module reveal that a judicious weighting between the parameter-level and latent channels yields an optimal trade-off between image quality and fingerprint robustness, making LIFD particularly suitable for scenarios in which either high visual fidelity or robust traceability is of paramount importance. In summary, LIFD provides a promising path toward accountable model distribution and responsible utilization of generative models. By ensuring that every generated image carries a verifiable digital signature of its source, our framework lays a solid foundation for future research directions, including the extension of these techniques to other data modalities such as text, audio, and video, as well as the further enhancement of resilience against sophisticated fingerprint removal strategies. Overall, our work represents an important step toward a future in which synthetic media can be deployed safely and responsibly, with robust mechanisms in place to maintain accountability and mitigate misuse.
