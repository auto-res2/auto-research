## Abstract
In protein structural biology, the exploration of protein conformational spaces is essential for understanding their functionality and facilitating advancements in both scientific knowledge and therapeutic applications. Conventional computational approaches, like molecular dynamics simulations, deliver precise analytical capabilities yet grapple with burdens such as sampling limitations and operational inefficiency. Our work introduces a novel model, the Hierarchically Bootstrapped Force-Guided SE(3) Diffusion model (HBFG-SE3), designed to mitigate these limitations. By employing a hierarchical sampling methodology complemented by an adaptive guidance refinement process, HBFG-SE3 integrates force-guided energy assessments to traverse complex conformational spaces effectively. Direct comparisons with established methodologies demonstrate that HBFG-SE3 significantly enhances sampling variability and precision in structural predictions while ensuring computational tractability. Empirical assessments underscore its transformative potential in protein conformation prediction tasks, holding substantial implications for areas like drug development and molecular biotechnology.
