Enhancing Defensibility in Conditional Diffusion Processes

## Abstract
\textbf{Abstract}

We propose the Consistent Sequential Trigger Defense (CSTD), a novel framework to enhance the robustness of diffusion models against backdoor attacks, addressing their prevalence within highly sensitive applications. Diffusion models, significant for their capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, are increasingly utilized across domains spanning artificial intelligence, image processing, and beyond. However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks—exploiting model vulnerabilities to embed adversarial functionalities—necessitates advanced countermeasures particularly resilient to challenging data conditions such as noisy or corrupted datasets. Key to CSTD's methodology are three pillars: Ambient-Consistent Trigger Estimation, leveraging denoising principles from diffusion theory to isolate malicious backdoor triggers amidst ambient noise; Sequential Score-Based Trigger Refinement, refining trigger contamination estimates iteratively through adaptive diffusion modeling; and Fast Defense Distillation, ensuring performance and efficiency by distilling the robustified model into a computationally efficient inference-ready module. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CSTD achieves state-of-the-art results in mitigating backdoor triggers, evidenced by improved benchmarks including true positive and negative rates and reduced computational overhead without compromising defense accuracy. Our findings distinctly position CSTD as a pivotal contribution toward more secure and reliable generative models, fostering stronger trust in their deployment across crucial fields.
