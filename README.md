## Abstract
Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of assigning accurate semantic labels to every pixel based on a diverse range of natural language descriptors while ensuring computational efficiency and robust generalization to unseen domains. In this work, we introduce Seed-Augmented Cost Aggregation for Segmentation (SAC-Seg), a novel framework that extends the cost aggregation concepts of CAT-Seg by incorporating a seed-based gradient approximation mechanism inspired by techniques in federated full-parameter tuning. SAC-Seg mitigates the computational burden of dense cost volume computations – wherein the cosine similarity between high-dimensional image and text embeddings (extracted from models such as CLIP) is computed over all pixel pairs – by partitioning each input image into patches and generating a finite set of randomly perturbed seed points per patch. Each seed point probes a representative region of the complete cost volume, yielding an efficient approximation of the similarity map while substantially reducing the number of forward and backward passes required during training. To further alleviate the expense of backpropagation through high-resolution cost volumes, our framework employs a zeroth-order gradient approximation strategy: for each seed point, the model performs two forward passes with slight positive and negative perturbations, and the difference between these passes is used to compute a scalar estimate of the local gradient. The aggregated local gradients subsequently guide the fine-tuning of both the vision-language encoder and the transformer-based aggregation modules, thereby reducing training time and memory usage while introducing an implicit regularization effect through the stochasticity of the seed perturbations. This regularization enhances the model’s robustness in scenarios with ambiguous segmentation targets and improves its adaptability to specialized domains such as medical imaging and engineering applications. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks including COCO-Stuff, ADE20K, PASCAL VOC, and PASCAL-Context, as well as on a multi-domain evaluation set (MESS benchmark), demonstrate that SAC-Seg achieves competitive performance, as measured by mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), pixel accuracy, and the Dice coefficient, while significantly improving computational efficiency. Our major contributions are summarized as follows: \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficient Seed-Guided Sampling:} We propose a strategy that partitions each image into patches and generates a finite set of randomly perturbed seed points to efficiently approximate the full dense cost volume, thereby drastically reducing the computational burden.
    \item \textbf{Zeroth-Order Gradient Approximation:} By employing a dual forward-pass mechanism with slight positive and negative perturbations, our method estimates scalar local gradients for each seed point, eliminating the need for exhaustive backpropagation through high-dimensional cost volumes and significantly reducing training time and memory consumption.
    \item \textbf{Robust Domain Adaptation:} The stochastic nature of the seed-guided sampling serves as an implicit regularizer that enhances the model's generalization to ambiguous segmentation targets and improves its performance across specialized domains.
\end{itemize}By integrating these innovations, the SAC-Seg framework overcomes the limitations of traditional dense cost aggregation methods and lays the foundation for scalable, robust, and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.
