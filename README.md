## Abstract
We introduce the SphericalShift Point Transformer (SSPT), a novel 3D point cloud processing framework that extends the scalable design of Point Transformer V3 (PTv3) by addressing two key limitations: the loss of spatial neighbor precision inherent in serialized attention and the slower convergence of the dot‐product attention mechanism. While PTv3 achieves state‐of‐the‐art performance across both indoor and outdoor tasks by efficiently expanding its receptive field from 16 to 1024 points through serialized attention coupled with enhanced conditional positional encoding, SSPT rethinks both data organization and the attention strategy to more precisely capture local geometric relationships. In our method, each point is first projected into a spherical coordinate system using a robust reference—such as one derived from principal component analysis—and subsequently grouped into patches using a hierarchical equal‐area grid inspired by HEALPix. This grouping preserves local spatial structures typically lost in conventional serializations. A shifted spherical‐window attention mechanism is then applied to ensure that boundaries between patches are revisited repeatedly, thereby recovering fine‐grained spatial relationships and mitigating neighbor precision loss. In parallel, SSPT incorporates a dual‐modal attention module that fuses standard dot‐product attention with a vector‐based correlation head through learnable fusion weights, enhancing training convergence and improving the capture of non‐linear geometric relationships. Complementing these components, a novel spherical positional encoding leverages angular coordinates and local curvature to inject informative contextual biases into the attention layers, ensuring robustness under rotations and scaling variations. Extensive experiments—including an end‐to‐end benchmark on datasets such as ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, a comprehensive component ablation study, and a robustness evaluation under rotational, scaling, and noise perturbations—demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scalable Design:} Extends the PTv3 architecture to efficiently process large-scale point clouds by significantly expanding the receptive field.
\item \textbf{Spherical Projection and Grouping:} Introduces a novel projection of points into a spherical coordinate system and groups them using a hierarchical equal-area grid inspired by HEALPix, thereby preserving local geometric coherence.
\item \textbf{Shifted Spherical-Window Attention:} Proposes an attention mechanism that employs shifted windows over the spherical grid to continuously capture cross-patch relationships and recover fine-grained spatial details.
\item \textbf{Dual-Modal Attention:} Fuses standard dot-product attention with a vector-based correlation head via learnable fusion weights, resulting in faster convergence and improved modeling of non-linear geometric relationships.
\item \textbf{Spherical Positional Encoding:} Develops a positional encoding based on angular coordinates and local curvature that provides robust contextual bias under transformations such as rotations and scaling.
\end{itemize}
Overall, SSPT redefines the paradigm for point cloud processing by integrating these innovations into a cohesive framework, thereby paving the way for future research on hybrid attention mechanisms and large-scale joint training strategies in 3D perception.
