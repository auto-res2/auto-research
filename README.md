## Abstract
This work presents Structure‐Guided Prior‐Conditioned Distilled Diffusion (SPCDD), a novel super‐resolution framework designed to generate high‐resolution 7T-like MRI images from standard 1.5T scans. Magnetic resonance imaging is indispensable for revealing fine microstructural details; however, the inherent spatial resolution limitations of conventional 1.5T systems constrain precise anatomical visualization, while the high cost and limited availability of 7T scanners restrict their clinical use. To address these challenges, SPCDD reduces reliance on externally computed bias field and gradient nonlinearity corrections and alleviates the need for extensive paired datasets. At the core of our method is a lightweight anatomy extractor, pre-trained in a self-supervised or weakly supervised manner, which directly produces segmentation masks and anatomical templates from 1.5T images. These internally generated anatomical priors capture critical structural features—such as tissue boundaries and anatomical landmarks—thereby providing a robust reference that emulates the superior quality of 7T imaging. The extracted priors are then incorporated into a conditional latent diffusion model that employs a U-Net architecture to denoise and reconstruct images, while an integrated intensity modulation pathway dynamically adjusts local contrast to mimic the intensity distribution of high-field scans. Moreover, a progressive distillation strategy is introduced in which an overparameterized teacher model, augmented with dual guidance from the anatomical extraction and intensity modulation modules, transfers its learned representations and intermediate feature maps to a compact student model. This step-by-step alignment substantially reduces the student model’s size, inference time, and GPU memory requirements while preserving high-fidelity reconstructions. An optional adversarial adaptation module, featuring a discriminator network, further enforces realistic intensity scaling and anatomical integrity when paired training data are scarce, thereby enhancing robustness and generalizability in diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on paired high-resolution 1.5T and 7T MRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project—including both T1- and T2-weighted modalities—demonstrate significant improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and custom structural fidelity metrics such as dice coefficients. Clinical validation on data from Massachusetts General Hospital confirms that SPCDD effectively reconstructs subtle anatomical details and restores local contrast, thereby facilitating improved diagnostic accuracy under low-resolution conditions. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Anatomical Prior Extraction:} Development of a lightweight, self-supervised anatomy extractor that generates segmentation masks and anatomical templates directly from 1.5T images, eliminating the dependency on externally computed bias and gradient corrections.
\item \textbf{Intensity Modulation Integration:} Introduction of a dynamic intensity modulation pathway that adjusts local contrast and intensity distributions to closely approximate those of 7T scans.
\item \textbf{Progressive Distillation Framework:} A novel teacher–student paradigm in which an overparameterized teacher model transfers key representational features to a compact student model through careful alignment of intermediate feature maps, significantly reducing computational cost without sacrificing reconstruction quality.
\item \textbf{Adversarial Adaptation for Unpaired Data:} Incorporation of an optional adversarial module with a discriminator network to enforce realistic intensity scaling and maintain anatomical fidelity in scenarios with limited paired data.
\end{itemize}
By leveraging internally extracted anatomical priors and adaptive intensity modulation within a principled diffusion framework, and by efficiently compressing model capacity through progressive distillation, the proposed SPCDD method bridges the gap between widely available 1.5T scanners and high-field 7T imaging, offering a robust and computationally efficient solution for real-time clinical deployment in resource-constrained settings.
